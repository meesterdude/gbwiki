# Contributing

There are two ways to contribute:

1. For most people, the [Public wiki](https://github.com/meesterdude/gbwiki/wiki) is the best place to contribute. 

2. If you're an expert with a lot to share, create a markdown file via pull-request, and include a section with wallet info for people to donate to, and if accepted will be linked to via this readme.
